3. Enter the API URL:
   ```
   http://localhost:3002/upload
   ```

##  **Troubleshooting**
- If you see `No file uploaded`, ensure:
  - You're using **form-data** in Postman.
  - The field name is exactly **file**.
- If the server doesnâ€™t start, check if **Node.js** is installed and dependencies are installed correctly.
